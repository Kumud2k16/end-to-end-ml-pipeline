# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline – Customer data Prediction

## Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning workflow to predict customer data using structured customer data. 
The goal is to demonstrate production-ready ML practices including ETL, feature engineering, model evaluation, and pipelines.

## Problem Statement
Customer data is costly for businesses. This project predicts whether a customer is likely to data based on demographics, account information, and service usage.
